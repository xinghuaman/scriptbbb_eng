    If the audio output device you want to use has not been
    recognized by the system, first check that it is switched on and
    is connected correctly.

    WARNING: some devices may require one to be followed
    precise ignition and / or connection sequence. If this does not come
    respected the interface may not work correctly and / or not
    be recognized at all by the system.

    Unfortunately, this (possible) sequence changes from one device to another:
    there is no general rule valid for everyone.
    E.g. some devices must be turned on before they are connected
    to the computer, while for others the opposite is true - they must be turned on
    only after they have been connected.
    It is also possible that in some cases the device must be switched on
    and / or connected only after the system has completed the boot sequence,
    while in others the opposite may be true (the device must be
    connected and switched on before startup, when the computer is switched off), etc.

    It is advisable to immediately carry out all the necessary checks; so far as
    it is necessary to restart the system, once the sequence has been completed
    start you will have to manually restart this script in order to complete the
    configuration.

    If despite all your device is not recognized,
    it is possible that it is not supported by the running kernel.

    In some cases the problem can be solved trivially by using one
    latest version of the kernel, which contains the most updated ALSA drivers:
    then try rebooting the system with a newer kernel, then
    start this script again.

    In other cases it may be necessary to install "drivers" (modules
    of the kernel) additional, not included directly in the kernel but provided
    separately from the hardware manufacturer or third parties.
    In this case unfortunately it is not possible to manage the thing automatically
    and you will have to intervene manually.
    This done, however, you can run this script again to complete
    the configuration.

    Finally, unfortunately there are some devices that, by choice of theirs
    same manufacturers, they are not and can not be supported by systems
    other than expected (usually certain versions of Windows
    and / or MacOS). In that case there is very little to do ... if not get rid of it
    and replace them with others that work well with Linux.

  You will now have to select the sampling frequencies of the
  digital audio streams ("sample-rate") that are directly supported
  from your audio output device.

  The actual limits of the system as a whole should be indicated: if
  use a system consisting of a separate interface + DAC, each with
  its own limits, the values ​​to be indicated are given by the subset of the
  sample-rates supported by both the interface and the DAC.

  For example, if you have a USB interface that supports all sample-rates a
  starting from 44.1 up to 384 kHz, but the connected DAC arrives only
  up to 192 kHz, the max limit to be specified is 192 kHz.
  If, on the other hand, a DAC able to arrive is connected to the same interface
  up to 768 kHz, the limit would be placed by the interface. Therefore in this
  in case the max. value to be specified would be 384 kHz.

  If you have any particular reason to want to do it, nothing forbids
  specify more restrictive limits than those imposed by
  your hardware. For example, if your system is able to manage
  streams up to 384 kHz but it works / sounds better up to 192 kHz, nothing
  forbids to set this value as an upper limit.

  Obviously the opposite is not true: set the limits to values ​​that
  exceed the maximum and / or are less than the minimum allowed by yours
  hardware is an error that leads to failure of the system.

  N.B .: regardless of the limits set, the system will be in any case
  can handle incoming audio streams with any sample rate that
  is supported by the software (LMS and squeezelite). If these exceed i
  physical limits of your hardware or anyway those set here, the
  software will automatically resample these streams in a way
  to make them compatible (make them fall within the limits).

  In fact, a possible reason for wanting to set more limits
  restrictive compared to what is allowed by the hardware is just that
  to "force" the resampling of incoming audio streams.

  For example, if your hardware supports audio streams up to 96 kHz and
  set this value as both a lower and a higher limit,
  the result will be that all incoming flows will be resampled
  just at this frequency ("upsampling" or a
  "downsampling", depending on whether the input flow is frequent
  sampling rate that is less than or greater than that required).

  Another commonly used possibility is to set the
  lower and upper limit to the frequencies corresponding to the maximums
  multiple integers supported by the hardware of the two "basic" frequencies,
  44.1 and 48 kHz, e.g. 176.4 and 192 kHz, or 352.8 and 384 kHz, etc.

  In this way it is possible to obtain a "synchronous resampling" of the
  incoming flows, that is to say that they are always resampled
  at most multiple integer (supported) of their base frequency.

  If instead you want (as far as possible) to avoid resampling
  (at least on the "player"), correctly indicate the actual limits
  minimum and maximum imposed by your hardware.
